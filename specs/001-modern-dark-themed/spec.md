**Input**: User description: "Modern dark-themed VS Code Insider podcast landing site with featured speakers, 20 mock episodes with transcripts, episode discovery & related episode navigation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints

   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)

   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a curious developer visiting the VS Code Insider podcast site, I want to quickly understand what the show offers, see featured conversations with notable speakers, browse or search episodes, and open an episode page that provides a full transcript and related recommendations so I can decide what to listen to next without friction.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a first-time visitor on the landing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see: site title, tagline, 3‚Äì5 featured speaker conversation cards (image/name/title/episode title teaser), a call to explore all episodes, and a dark theme interface consistent across viewport sizes.
2. **Given** a visitor on the landing page, **When** they click "View All Episodes", **Then** they are taken to an Episodes listing page showing at least 20 episode summaries (title, number, publish date, short abstract, speakers) with pagination or lazy load.
3. **Given** a visitor on the Episodes page, **When** they select an episode card, **Then** they navigate to that Episode page displaying full title, publish metadata, participating speakers, embedded player placeholder, complete transcript (mock), and a Related Episodes section (3‚Äì6 items) based on shared speakers or topic tags.
4. **Given** a visitor on an Episode page, **When** they click a related episode, **Then** the new episode page loads with updated transcript and recommendations.
5. **Given** a visitor scrolling the landing page on mobile, **When** they reach featured speakers, **Then** cards are readable, accessible, and maintain contrast without horizontal scroll.
6. **Given** a visitor using keyboard navigation, **When** they tab through interactive elements, **Then** focus order follows visual hierarchy and all actionable elements are reachable.

### Edge Cases
- Episode has a speaker appearing in multiple episodes: related section prioritizes diversity (no more than 2 episodes featuring the same primary speaker unless <3 total candidates exist).
- Transcript extremely long (e.g., >15k characters): initial view shows first 8 segments (~first 2,500‚Äì3,000 characters) with an "Expand Full Transcript" control (progressive disclosure).
- Missing speaker image asset: fallback avatar with initials displayed.
- User opens direct deep link to an episode referencing a speaker not on landing: page still loads correctly.
- Network latency / partial transcript load: display skeleton state until segments ready (target <500ms render after data available).
- Mobile very narrow (<360px): single-column layout; no horizontal scroll.

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a public landing page presenting site title, tagline, and a featured speakers/conversations section.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display 3‚Äì5 featured conversation cards selectable for navigation to their episode pages.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide an Episodes listing page with at least 20 mock episodes initially available.
- **FR-004**: System MUST show each episode summary with: episode number, title, publish date, 1‚Äì2 sentence abstract, primary speakers.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow navigation from any episode summary or featured card to its detailed episode page.
- **FR-006**: System MUST render an Episode detail page containing: full title, episode number, publish date, duration (mock), speaker list (names + roles), full transcript (segmented), and related episodes list.
- **FR-007**: System MUST compute related episodes using shared speaker or shared tag criteria (minimum one match) excluding the current episode.
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure related episodes list size between 3 and 6 when enough qualifying episodes exist; if fewer qualify, show all available (minimum 1 if exists).
- **FR-009**: System MUST support keyboard-only navigation across landing, episodes list, and episode detail pages.
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain WCAG AA contrast in dark theme for text, buttons, and interactive states.
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide fallback visuals (placeholder avatar) when a speaker image asset is unavailable.
- **FR-012**: System MUST show a visible loading state if transcript retrieval exceeds 300ms.
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent duplicate listing of the current episode in related episodes.
- **FR-014**: System MUST present consistent primary navigation accessible from all pages (e.g., Home / Episodes).
- **FR-015**: System MUST segment long transcripts and initially collapse after the first 8 segments with an expand control.
- **FR-016**: System MUST default episode ordering to newest ‚Üí oldest by publish date.
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide a lightweight client-side keyword filter (title, speaker name, tag) on the Episodes listing page.
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide at least 20 unique mock episode data objects for development & validation.
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow direct deep linking to any episode page via stable URL structure.
- **FR-020**: System MUST expose accessibility roles/labels for interactive cards and navigation landmarks.
- **FR-021**: System MUST rank related episodes by (1) shared speaker count, (2) tag overlap count, (3) recency; enforce diversity cap of max 2 entries sharing the same primary speaker unless insufficient pool (<3 candidates).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Episode**: number, title, abstract, publish date, duration (mock), speakers (references), topic tags, transcript segments (references), derived related episodes, hero image (optional), slug.
- **Speaker**: name, role/title, optional short bio, avatar reference, associated episodes list.
- **Transcript Segment**: sequence index, episode reference, speaker name, text (‚â§1200 chars), approximate character length.
- **Related Episode Relationship (Derived)**: ranking tuple (shared_speakers, tag_overlap_count, recency_rank) computed on demand.

### Confirmed Scope & Decisions
1. Public-only experience; no auth.
2. Audio integration deferred; placeholder only.
3. Minimal keyword filter included; full-text transcript search deferred.
4. Transcripts stored as segmented plain text with speaker attribution; no rich formatting.
5. Featured speakers curated manually; fallback selects top 3‚Äì5 by episode count then recency.
6. Related diversity rule enforced (see FR-021).
7. Long transcript progressive disclosure (see FR-015).
8. Tag overlap threshold: ‚â•1 shared tag qualifies.
9. Baseline performance targets: Landing TTI <1s (mock data), transcript render <500ms after data ready.
10. Accessibility baseline: All interactive elements keyboard reachable with visible focus outline; segments use semantic containers for assistive tech navigation.
