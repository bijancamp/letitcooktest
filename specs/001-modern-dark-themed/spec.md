**Feature Branch**: `001-modern-dark-themed`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Modern dark-themed VS Code Insider podcast landing site with featured speakers, 20 mock episodes with transcripts, episode discovery & related episode navigation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a curious developer visiting the VS Code Insider podcast site, I want to quickly understand what the show offers, see featured conversations with notable speakers, browse or search episodes, and open an episode page that provides a full transcript and related recommendations so I can decide what to listen to next without friction.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a first-time visitor on the landing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see: site title, tagline, 3‚Äì5 featured speaker conversation cards (image/name/title/episode title teaser), a call to explore all episodes, and a dark theme interface consistent across viewport sizes.
2. **Given** a visitor on the landing page, **When** they click "View All Episodes", **Then** they are taken to an Episodes listing page showing at least 20 episode summaries (title, number, publish date, short abstract, speakers) with pagination or lazy load.
3. **Given** a visitor on the Episodes page, **When** they select an episode card, **Then** they navigate to that Episode page displaying full title, publish metadata, participating speakers, embedded player placeholder, complete transcript (mock), and a Related Episodes section (3‚Äì6 items) based on shared speakers or topic tags.
4. **Given** a visitor on an Episode page, **When** they click a related episode, **Then** the new episode page loads with updated transcript and recommendations.
5. **Given** a visitor scrolling the landing page on mobile, **When** they reach featured speakers, **Then** cards are readable, accessible, and maintain contrast without horizontal scroll.
6. **Given** a visitor using keyboard navigation, **When** they tab through interactive elements, **Then** focus order follows visual hierarchy and all actionable elements are reachable.

### Edge Cases
- Episode has a speaker appearing in multiple episodes: related section should prioritize diversity (no duplicate listing of current episode, avoid listing more than 2 episodes from same speaker unless <3 alternatives exist).
- Transcript extremely long (e.g., > 15k characters): UI still renders with collapsible sections or virtual scroll [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should transcript support collapsible segments?].
- Missing speaker image asset: fallback avatar with initials displayed.
- User opens direct deep link to an episode that references a speaker not in featured set: page still loads and does not assume presence on landing.
- Network latency / partial load of transcript: display skeleton/loader state with clear indicator.
- Mobile narrow viewport (<360px): layout degrades gracefully without overlapping text.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a public landing page presenting site title, tagline, and a featured speakers/conversations section.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display 3‚Äì5 featured conversation cards selectable for navigation to their episode pages.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide an Episodes listing page with at least 20 mock episodes initially available.
- **FR-004**: System MUST show each episode summary with: episode number, title, publish date, 1‚Äì2 sentence abstract, primary speakers.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow navigation from any episode summary or featured card to its detailed episode page.
- **FR-006**: System MUST render an Episode detail page containing: full title, episode number, publish date, duration (mock), speaker list (names + roles), full transcript (mock textual content), and related episodes list.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide related episodes based on at least one shared attribute (shared speaker OR shared topic tag) excluding the current episode.
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure related episodes list size between 3 and 6 when enough qualifying episodes exist; if fewer qualify, show all available (minimum 1 if exists).
- **FR-009**: System MUST support keyboard-only navigation across landing, episodes list, and episode detail pages.
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain WCAG AA contrast in dark theme for text, buttons, and interactive states.
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide fallback visuals (placeholder avatar) when a speaker image asset is unavailable.
- **FR-012**: System MUST load transcript content such that a loading state is visible if content retrieval exceeds 300ms (mock condition acceptable for spec).
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent duplicate listing of the current episode in related episodes.
- **FR-014**: System MUST present consistent primary navigation accessible from all pages (e.g., Home / Episodes) without specifying implementation mechanics.
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle long transcripts without layout break (scrollable area or sectioning) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: transcript segmentation approach not specified].
- **FR-016**: System MUST ensure episode ordering default is newest to oldest by publish date.
- **FR-017**: System MUST support basic discovery via browsing and related navigation; no search requirement explicitly stated [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is search/filter required now or deferred?].
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide at least 20 unique mock episode data objects for development & validation.
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow direct deep linking to any episode page via stable URL structure.
- **FR-020**: System MUST ensure accessibility roles/labels for interactive cards and navigation landmarks.

*Ambiguity Markers Added Where Product Clarification Needed.*

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Episode**: Represents a podcast installment; attributes (non-implementation): number, title, subtitle/abstract, publish date, duration (mock), speakers (references), topic tags, transcript text (long-form), related episodes (derived), hero image (optional), slug/identifier.
- **Speaker**: Represents an individual featured in one or more episodes; attributes: name, role/title, short bio (optional), avatar reference, associated episode references.
- **Transcript**: Narrative content of an episode; attributes: episode reference, full textual content, (optional) segmented blocks with speaker attribution [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is per-speaker segmentation required?].
- **Related Episode Relationship (Derived)**: Not stored as primary data‚Äîcomputed by shared speaker or overlapping tag set above threshold [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum tag overlap threshold?].

Assumptions (pending confirmation):
1. No authentication or user accounts in scope.
2. No audio streaming implementation required beyond placeholder reference.
3. No search bar or filtering unless clarified.
4. Transcripts can be plain text (no formatting requirements specified yet).
5. Featured speakers subset curated manually (not auto-generated) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: curation rule or manual editorial control?].
